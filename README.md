# Gcp-agent-banking-assistant
It a banking assistant chat bot , which helps customers to check the balance,change the address and get the credit details.
In this repository there are three ipynb which are designed for each model.
create database with duplicate records using spanner for check the balance,change the address.
create a csv file for get the credit details and store it in the cloud storage
we should deply the code in ipynb in the Gcp workbench.
Once we run all the code then three cloud function links will be created.
Now in gcp ai applications, create an app i.e a conversational agent with build your own feature.
create playbooks for each module and tools with open api with yaml as link to the cloud function links.
now toggle the agent for testing.
