It a banking assistant chat bot , which helps customers to check the balance,change the address and get the credit details.<br>
In this repository there are three ipynb which are designed for each model.<br>
create database with duplicate records using spanner for check the balance,change the address.<br>
create a csv file for get the credit details and store it in the cloud storage<br>
we should deply the code in ipynb in the Gcp workbench.<br>
Once we run all the code then three cloud function links will be created.<br>
Now in gcp ai applications, create an app i.e a conversational agent with build your own feature.<br>
create playbooks for each module and tools with open api with yaml as link to the cloud function links.<br>
now toggle the agent for testing.<br>
